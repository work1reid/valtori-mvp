            <p style="margin: 0;">Unhinged is a comedy tool that generates <strong>intentionally absurd, satirical content</strong> for entertainment purposes. The generated content is meant to be funny, not to be actually used to message strangers. Think of it like a Cards Against Humanity generator - shocking for laughs, not for real use.</p>
